Description                : This is my first major level which includes most of the stuff I know
                             all in one level. There is also a storyline( something most levels
                             seem to lack), so sit back and listen. You start watching your TV(which 
                             is "accidentally" on the porn channel), well, what else is there to do
                             on the way back from fighting some alien scum in the outer regions of
 		             the galaxy. You are dreaming of your bird back on Omega Station, which
                             is where you are heading. As you dock you hear screams and gunfire, there 
                             is an army ship docked and a green unidentified blob. You decide to be 
                             causious, you must find your weapons in your quarters and prepare for the 
                             unknown.
