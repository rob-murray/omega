# Omega Station

Duke Nukem 3D level - Omega Station

Originally written 1990s sometime ðŸ•¹

### Description

This is my first major level which includes most of the stuff I know
all in one level. There is also a storyline (something most levels
seem to lack), so sit back and listen. You start watching your TV - which
is "accidentally" on the porn channel - well, what else is there to do
on the way back from fighting some alien scum in the outer regions of
the galaxy. You are dreaming of your bird back on Omega Station, which
is where you are heading. As you dock you hear screams and gunfire, there
is an army ship docked and a green unidentified blob. You decide to be
causious, you must find your weapons in your quarters and prepare for the
unknown.
